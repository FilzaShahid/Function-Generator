# Function-Generator

# Objectives:-

The objective is to build a function generator capable of generating square, triangle, and sine waves.  The frequency and amplitude of these waves will be controlled through potentiometers.  There will be some frequency analysis to aid in the understanding of Laplace transforms, Bode plots, and Fourier series.

# Simulation Part:-

Part One: Square Wave Generator 

Part Two: Integrator 

Part Three: Low-Pass Filter 

Part Four: Function Generator

# Hardware Part:-

Part One: Build the Function Generator

Part Two: Analyzing the Function Generator 

Part Three: Connecting the Function Generator to a Speaker 

# Take Home Task:-

Using TL494 for the Generation of Different Duty Cycles at Different Frequencies
